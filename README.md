# Anime Categories Table

We chose an anime table concept where we can store different anime titles in their own respected categories. We wanted a simpler way to store our watchlists in an organized way and this was the perfect time. Choose the table/category you want to input your anime title into and save it! then you can go back and see them all in a table.

## Tables

** - Shonen
 - Slice-of-life
 - Isekai
 - Comedy
 - Romance**
